print cards

Usage: losrs show [OPTIONS] <PATH> [PROMPT_FINGERPRINT]

Arguments:
  <PATH>
          The path to the file to read

  [PROMPT_FINGERPRINT]
          Fingerprint of the card's prompt. Use metadata command to find one

Options:
      --format <FORMAT>
          [default: clean]
          [possible values: clean, typst, sixel, storage]

      --ppi <PPI>
          Pixel density in PPI (Pixels Per Inch).
          
          Used with image based formats.
          
          [default: 96]

      --base-font-size <BASE_FONT_SIZE>
          "base" font size in points.
          
          Everything is scaled relative to this font size.
          
          It is best to set this to the same font size as your terminal font size.
          
          Used with image based formats.
          
          [default: 12]

      --line-height-scaling <LINE_HEIGHT_SCALING>
          Height of the line relative to the font size.
          
          Used for figuring out vertical size of the card.
          
          Some terminals allow scaling line height (and some scale by default), this value needs to be known to calculate the right image size.
          
          It is best to set this to the same line height scaling as your terminal line height scaling.
          
          Used with image based formats.
          
          [default: 1.2]
